# TomatoSynth V2.0
![TomatoSynth Visual Example](https://github.com/SCT-lab/TomatoSynth/blob/main/Images/greenhouse3.png)


## What is TomatoSynth ?
TomatoSynth, as a Unity package and executable (.exe) application, provides realistic synthetic training data for deep learning applications, reducing the need for manual annotation and allowing customization for specific greenhouse environments, thus advancing automation in agriculture.

## Features

* <img src="https://github.com/SCT-lab/TomatoSynth/blob/main/Images/VC.png" width="20"> User interface, with controllable camera

The FSP models benchmark tomato plants were created using the 3D modelling platform GroIMP. Plant characteristics were determined by randomly sampling various parameters, such as leaf length and width and number of trusses and leaves. The 3D meshes generated by GroIMP were edited in Blender as not every tomato was recognised as a separate object, making it not possible to manipulate them individually.

## Installation
<p>
  TomatoSynth can be used either as a <strong>standalone Windows application (.exe)</strong>
  or as a <strong>Unity project</strong>, which allows further editing and export to different formats.
</p>

<h3>1. Standalone Application (Windows)</h3>

<p>
  <strong>1a. Unzip required files</strong><br>
  Locate the file <strong>"1. Unzip_first.zip"</strong> inside the <em>TomatoSynth Data</em> folder.
  Unzip its contents <strong>directly into the Data folder</strong> (do not create a new subfolder).
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1b. Output data location</strong><br>
  Recorded data will be stored in the <code>TomatoSynth_Data</code> folder, in two subfolders:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>Screenshot</code></li>
  <li><code>ScreenshotGT</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Unity Project</h3>

<p>
  <strong>2a. Add project to Unity Hub</strong><br>
  Add the contents of the <strong>V2.0 Unity</strong> folder to Unity Hub.
  Unity version <strong>2022.23f1</strong> is recommended, although older versions may also work.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>2b. First launch setup</strong><br>
  On the first launch, Unity will install the required packages. This may take some time.
  The main Unity scene can be found at:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Assets → Scenes → Menu → StartScene</strong>
</p>

<h3>Scene Behavior and Tomato Placement</h3>

<p>
  When launching the standalone application or running the project in Unity, the script
  <code>Positioning_tomatoes</code> processes the input tomato models (three prefabs in total)
  and places them in rows.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Each compartment can receive a unique tomato model.</li>
  <li>
    Row variation is achieved by:
    <ul>
      <li>Offsetting each row’s starting position by <strong>2 cm</strong> relative to the previous row.</li>
      <li>Rotating each tomato by <strong>45°</strong> relative to its neighboring plant.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
