# TomatoSynth V1.0
![TomatoSynth Visual Example](https://github.com/SCT-lab/TomatoSynth/blob/main/Images/greenhouse3.png)


## What is TomatoSynth ?
TomatoSynth, as a Unity package and executable (.exe) application, provides realistic synthetic training data for deep learning applications, reducing the need for manual annotation and allowing customization for specific greenhouse environments, thus advancing automation in agriculture.

## Features

The FSP models benchmark tomato plants were created using the 3D modelling platform GroIMP. Plant characteristics were determined by randomly sampling various parameters, such as leaf length and width and number of trusses and leaves. The 3D meshes generated by GroIMP were edited in Blender as not every tomato was recognised as a separate object, making it not possible to manipulate them individually.

## Installation
TomatoSynth can be run as an .exe file for Windows, or as a Unity package, where it can be further edited and exported in different formats.

<b>1a)</b> <u>Application:</u> unzip the file within the TomatoSynth Data folder titled <B>"1. Unzip_first.zip"</b>. Unzip the files within the Data folder - not in a new folder.<br>
<b>1b)</b> The recording data will be put within the TomatoSynth_Data folder in two folders titled Screenshot and ScreenshotGT.<br>

<b>2a)</b> <u>Unity:</u> content of the V2.0 Unity folder can be added in Unity Hub. Unity version <b>2022.23f1</b> needs to be installed on the PC. Older versions might work too.<br>
<b>2b)</b> Upon launching for the first time, packages need to be installed. This might take some time. The Unity scene can be found in the <u>Assets - Scenes folder (Menu / StartScene)</u>.

When launching the application or running the software within Unity itself, a script (Positioning_tomatoes) takes the input tomato models (three prefabs total) and places them in rows. For each compartment, unique tomato models can be given as input. Variation in the rows is realised by starting each row on a different start position (difference of 2 cm compared to previous row); and each plant in the row is given a 45 degrees difference to its neighbour.
