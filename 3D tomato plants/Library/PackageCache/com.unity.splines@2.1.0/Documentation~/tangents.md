# Tangents

Tangents define the in and out curvature of a knot's segments. 

Tangents have a magnitude and direction. Magnitude determines how much that tangent affects the curvature of its respective segment. A high magnitude value increases a tangent's influence on a segment's curvature and a low magnitude decreases it. Direction determines where the tangent points to from its parent knot. 

A spline or knot's tangent mode determines how their tangents are calculated. If a knot is in the **Bezier** tangent mode, then you can directly manipulate its tangents in the Scene view. If a knot is in the [Auto](tangent-modes.md#auto-tangent-mode) or [Linear](tangent-modes.md#linear-tangent-mode) tangent mode, its tangents are calculated automatically.
