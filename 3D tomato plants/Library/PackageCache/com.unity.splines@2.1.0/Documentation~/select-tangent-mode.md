To select a tangent mode:
1. [!include[select-spline](.\snippets\select-spline.md)]
1. [!include[set-spline-context](.\snippets\set-spline-context.md)]
1. Select the knots or tangents that you want to select a tangent mode for.  
1. In the **Element Inspector** overlay, select a [tangent mode](tangent-modes.md).
