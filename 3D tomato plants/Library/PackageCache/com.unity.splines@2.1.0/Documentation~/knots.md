# Knots

Knots are connected control points that make up splines. Knots connect to each other with segments. A knot can have a tangent that controls the curvature of the segments that knot connects to.

Use knots to change the shape of a spline. For more information, refer to [Manipulate splines](manipulate-splines.md).
