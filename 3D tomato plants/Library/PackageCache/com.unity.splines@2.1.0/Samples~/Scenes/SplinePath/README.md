# Spline path sample

This sample showcases the use of the `SplinePath`, `SplineSlice`, and `SplineRange` types. These types can create cohesive paths from collections of partial or complete sections of unrelated splines. See the `NPCSplinePathExample.cs`, `HighwayExample.cs`, and `CameraPathExample.cs` scripts to see how to create a `SplinePath` from multiple splines of the `ISpline` type and evaluate their positions, tangents, and up vectors.


Play the sample scene to see the different `SplinePath`s in action.
