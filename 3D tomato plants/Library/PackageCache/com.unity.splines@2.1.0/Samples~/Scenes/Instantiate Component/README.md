# Spline Instantiate sample

The Spline Instantiate sample demonstrates how the **Spline Instantiate** component instantiates prefabs along a spline.

Refer to how the following GameObjects in the scene use the **Spline Instantiate** component:

- The **Fences** GameObject use the **Linear Distance** instantiate method to precisely follow the spline. 
- The **Trees** and **Grass** GameObjects use **Offset** to move instances away from the spline.
- The **PathSpline** GameObject demonstrates simple path instantiation.
- The **Environment** GameObject groups the other samples in this scene together.
