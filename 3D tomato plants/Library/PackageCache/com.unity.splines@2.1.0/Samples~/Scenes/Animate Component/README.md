# Animate Component sample

This sample demonstrates how the **Spline Animate** component can animate the position and rotation of a GameObject along a spline. 

In the scene, the child GameObjects of **NoEasing** move linearly, while the child GameObjects of **WithEasing** have quadratic in and out easing. In addition, each parent's animated GameObjects have different loop modes. 

Inspect GameObjects whose name begins with **AnimateObject** for more detail and for an example of how to configure the **Spline Animate** component. 

To view the animations of the **Spline Animate** component in the Game view, enter Play mode.

To view the animations of the **Spline Animate** component in the Scene view:

1. Select a GameObject whose name begins with **AnimateObject**. 
2. In the Inspector, click **Play** in the **Spline Animate** component's **Preview** panel.
